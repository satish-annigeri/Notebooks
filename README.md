Notebooks
=========

IPython Notebooks is a collection of IPython notebook files on using Python for teaching Numerical Methods to 
undergraduate engineering students. It is a little unorganized, but useful. Most of the material is based on 
Jaan Kiusalaas, Numerical Methods in Engineering with Python, Cambridge University Press, 2005.
